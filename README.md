# Airline Passenger Satisfaction

## About

This project analyzes customer satisfaction scores from over 120,000 airline passengers. The dataset includes various factors such as passenger information, flight details, and evaluations of different aspects like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.

The main objective of this project is to predict the level of satisfaction of airline passengers. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, we aim to gain insights into the key factors influencing customer satisfaction and provide valuable recommendations for improving the airline experience.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

1. ID: Unique passenger identifier
2. Gender: Gender of the passenger (Female/Male)
3. Age: Age of the passenger
4. Customer Type: Type of airline customer (First-time/Returning)
5. Type of Travel: Purpose of the flight (Business/Personal)
6. Class: Travel class in the airplane for the passenger seat
7. Flight Distance: Flight distance in miles
8. Departure Delay: Flight departure delay in minutes
9. Arrival Delay: Flight arrival delay in minutes
10. Departure and Arrival Time Convenience: Satisfaction level with the convenience of the flight departure and arrival times
11. Ease of Online Booking: Satisfaction level with the online booking experience
12. Check-in Service: Satisfaction level with the check-in service
13. Online Boarding: Satisfaction level with the online boarding experience
14. Gate Location: Satisfaction level with the gate location in the airport
15. On-board Service: Satisfaction level with the on-board service
16. Seat Comfort: Satisfaction level with the comfort of the airplane seat
17. Leg Room Service: Satisfaction level with the legroom of the airplane seat
18. Cleanliness: Satisfaction level with the cleanliness of the airplane
19. Food and Drink: Satisfaction level with the food and drinks on the airplane
20. In-flight Service: Satisfaction level with the in-flight service
21. In-flight Wifi Service: Satisfaction level with the in-flight WiFi service
22. In-flight Entertainment: Satisfaction level with the in-flight entertainment
23. Baggage Handling: Satisfaction level with the baggage handling from the airline
24. Satisfaction: Overall satisfaction level with the airline (Satisfied/Neutral or Unsatisfied)

## Results

In our analysis, we utilized various machine learning algorithms and evaluated their performance in predicting passenger satisfaction. Here are the results we obtained:

- Logistic Regression:
  - Training accuracy: 87.43%
  - Testing accuracy: 87.48%
  - F1 Score: 0.8518

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
  - Training accuracy: 94.38%
  - Testing accuracy: 93.08%

- Decision Tree Classifier:
  - Accuracy: 94.63%
